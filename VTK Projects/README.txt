These are class projects from CIS 410 Scientific Visualizations taught by Hank Childs. In this class we learned how to implement algorithms and techniques such as Field interpolation, Coloring, Advection and streamlines, Isolines, Isosurfaces. Additionally, we worked with the software VTK. The main programming language in this class was c++.
