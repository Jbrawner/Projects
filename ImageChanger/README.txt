These are class projects from CIS 330: C/C++ AND UNIX taught by Hank Childs. In this class we learned how to implement large system and object oriented programming. The main programming language in this class was c++. The main goal of this assignment is to create a demand driven excution for a program that can manipulate photos with such filters as crop, shrinker, blender, LRconcat, TB concat, checkboard, transpose, invert.
